Project 1, Project 2, Project 3 and Project 4 are Statistical Learning projects created in R.

TwoTowers and SubsetIterator contains a Java code that helped me understand recursion and object oriented programming.
TwoTowers finds every subset of n blocks to find two towers that are closest in height out of all the subsets.
